# About me:
My Name Is Bobby Scheneider, known as Trico Everfire.
I'm 22 years old, Dutch, and fluent in english.
My hobbies include coding, gaming and making maps for games like
portal 2.

I have extensive knowledge in:
Javascript (5~ years experience), Typescript (1.5~ years experience),
C++ (1~ years experience) and Java (2~ years experience).

# Associated with:
I've worked on quite a few professional projects, most of which were under NDA
and cannot give any visual details.
Such project include:
### Hawkwhisper Database:
    A  high end JavaScript database designed to safely
    store json in multiple files and encrypt them with
    a custom written encryption algorythm. Allowing for
    a theoretical infinite amount of custom encryption
    keys to be inserted to allow saftey not to just
    lie by 1 key.
    
### The Last Doctor:
    The Last Doctor is a yet to be released custom coded game
    created by a medical student in the attempt to make 
    learning medical information easier for med students. 
    It's a professionally developed game. I sadly can't tell much
    due to NDA restrictions.

### TheUnproPro&#46;com:
    TheUnproPro.com is a discontinued website that made it easy to
    commission freelancers, It had it's own custom account handler
    and used the aformentioned Hawkwhisper Database, It was
    discontinued after the people involved moved on to other
    projects, as although commissions did come in, they got jobs
    in their respective sectors (HTML/JS/CSS web design).
    
    
There are a bunch of open source projects I contributed to:

### [Rpg Paper Maker:](https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker/Game-Scripts)
    RPG Paper Maker is a fully open source Typescript/Javascript engine.
    It's aim is to create a fast, easy to use and easy to understand
    codebase, It was developed by Wano, a indie engine developer and
    is still maintained by Wano, as well as other contributors
    (including myself). I wrote the Engine's Plugin handler,
    known as Inject, Inject uses under the hood JavaScript class
    prototyping and aliassing to abstract the process of altering
    existing engine classes. allowing for instanced and static 
    method and value alteration. All while maintaining Intellisense.
    
### [Portal 2 Map Publisher](https://github.com/Trico-Everfire/p2-publishing-tool)
    Portal 2 Map Publisher is a tool developed by me with the intend
    of replacing Portal 2's native map publisher with something that
    lives up to modern standards, as well as add newer steam feature support.
    Developed in C++ with the QT framework, it's fast, multi platform and
    allows for features not found in the original like:
    
    Custom tags.
    Multiple preview images.
    Multiple preview videos.
    And allowing you to set the map's visbility.
    
### [Celeste (minecraft plugin)](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Celeste/pull/5)
    Celeste is a small minecraft plugin that aims to add shooting stars to minecraft
    I made a Pull Request that adds:
    - support for multiple minecraft worlds to have stars.
    - for the amount of stars to be a per world option.
    - to allow loot tables to be chosen for loot.
    - set the start and end time for the star spawning (also per world).
    
    as well as some other smaller features. This PR is still currently in
    review.
